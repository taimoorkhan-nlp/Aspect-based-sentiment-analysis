    "Conventional sentiment analysis typically assigns an overall sentiment label (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral) to an entire text. While this is sufficient for many applications, it lacks the granularity needed in scenarios where sentiment varies across different aspects. For instance, in a restaurant review, a customer may rate the restaurant positively overall but criticize the service. In such cases, ABSA helps capture the sentiment towards individual aspects, such as identifying that the sentiment toward “service” is negative, despite the overall positive review."

    "Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is particularly useful in analyzing hotel reviews, where customers express opinions on multiple aspects of their stay, such as cleanliness, staff behavior, room quality, location, and amenities. Traditional sentiment analysis may label a review as positive or negative as a whole, but ABSA allows for a more nuanced understanding by identifying sentiment tied to specific aspects. For example, a guest might praise the hotel's location and service but complain about the room's cleanliness. By applying ABSA, hotel management can gain detailed insights into what aspects need improvement while maintaining strengths. Additionally, potential customers can make informed decisions based on sentiments about aspects that matter most to them. This fine-grained analysis helps hotels enhance customer experience and tailor their services to meet guest expectations more effectively.\n",

    "Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a challenging task as it involves both identifying relevant \"aspects\" within a text and assigning sentiment labels to them.

    "## Topic Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to identify hidden thematic structures in a large collection of text data. It helps discover topics that frequently occur in a dataset without requiring prior labeling or annotation. One of the most widely used topic modeling methods is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which represents documents as mixtures of topics, with each topic consisting of a set of words with varying probabilities. Topic modeling is commonly applied in text mining, information retrieval, document classification, and content recommendation systems. It enables researchers and businesses to analyze vast amounts of textual data, uncover trends, and gain insights into discussions, making it a valuable tool in areas such as social media analysis, academic research, and customer feedback categorization."

    "Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. It involves classifying text into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral, enabling businesses and researchers to analyze opinions, feedback, and trends. Sentiment analysis is widely applied in various domains, including social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, brand reputation management, and market research. Advanced sentiment analysis techniques, such as deep learning and transformer-based models, enhance accuracy by capturing contextual nuances, sarcasm, and complex emotions within text data."
